'''
Refactor a Python script that contains repeated if–elif–else grading logic by implementing a structured, object-oriented solution using a class and a method.
Problem Statement
The given script contains duplicated conditional statements used to assign grades based on student marks. This redundancy violates clean code principles and reduces maintainability.
You are required to refactor the script using a class-based design to improve modularity, reusability, and readability while preserving the original grading logic.
Mandatory Implementation Requirements
1. Class Name: GradeCalculator
2. Method Name: calculate_grade(self, marks)
3. The method must:
o Accept marks as a parameter.
o Return the corresponding grade as a string.
o The grading logic must strictly follow the conditions below:
▪ Marks ≥ 90 and ≤ 100 → "Grade A"
▪ Marks ≥ 80 → "Grade B"
▪ Marks ≥ 70 → "Grade C"
▪ Marks ≥ 40 → "Grade D"
▪ Marks ≥ 0 → "Fail"
     Note: Assume marks are within the valid range of 0 to 100.
4. Include proper docstrings for:
o The class
o The method (with parameter and return descriptions)
5. The method must be reusable and called multiple times without rewriting conditional logic.
• Given code:
marks = 85
if marks >= 90:
   print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
   print("Grade B")
else:
   print("Grade C")
marks = 72
if marks >= 90:
   print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
   print("Grade B")
else:
   print("Grade C")
